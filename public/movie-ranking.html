<h1>Bailee's Top Three Movies</h1>
<h2>My favorite movies!</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>This movie is so sweet and I love the art style.</p>

<h3>Mean Girls</h3>
<p>A classic. Truly. We stan Lindsay Lohan.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</h3>
<p>My favorite HP movie. Not quite as childlike as the first three and it starts to take a darker turn in this film. I also love the ball scene.</p>
